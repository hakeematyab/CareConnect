Your doctor should gradually shift you on alternative painkillers if at all needed. Heavy periods and vomiting has got something to do with hormonal imbalance probably, and a gynecological consult is necessary. If USG is not finding anything, simple anti-emetics before periods must be taken and may be prescribed by genes specialist after giving you internal check and hormonal profile. If you are having abdominal pain, then maybe colonoscopy may be necessary for bowel symptoms/findings that has made your doctor think on those

I was hospitalized for a week and given massive doses of IV steroids. After discharge I was still extremely ill with shortness of breath, week muscles, body aches, and my fingers and toes made involuntary movements that felt like they were sliding out of joint. My eyes would close by themeslves. I had a facial tick as well. Since that time I still have muscle aches and sharp pains in my legs. I have small nodules in one lung and I suffer from fatigue. Some days I just feel bad. Recently I can feel the tick starting in my face again. I have blurred vision and can not control my bladder. My bowel movements have become more frequent and changed in texture. My blood work showes Sjogrens Syndrom but the lip biopsy was negative. I had one positive Lupus test and one negative.

But about a wek after my last period the condom broke between my legs. I immediately check to see if my boyfriend had any precum coming from his penis. There was none, usually if there is it would pretty much be flowing out. Anyways Im just really nervous because I should be expecting my period in a few days now. Do you think there is a chance I can be pregnant?                                                                            The condom broke between my legs.

Diabetes can damage the blood vessels and nerves that control erection. Therefore, even if you have normal amounts of male hormones, and you have the desire to have sex, you still may not be able to achieve a firm erection.2) Pts with Type 2 DM usually suffer from - Premature ejaculation, whereas you are c/o delayed ejaculation and that too with good libido. If you can't release your semen by regular intercourse - 1) Start intercourse only after fully aroused mentally (even though you have good libido) and think only sex (in any form) during intercourse 2) Oral and other ways can be tried.

Relax The delay in her period is because of the pill. In all probability she will start her periods within 10 days. So do not worry. I hope this is helpful. Best wishes, CareConnect.</td>\n","      <td>Preejaculate does contain few sperms and so it can cause pregnancy. A week before the expected period is safe.

I understand your concern. Pain in testis need to be evaluated by color Doppler. It could be trauma or infection or varicocele etc. Color Doppler will give more confirmation. Proper physical examinations and investigation will help to rule out pathology like orchids or epididymis orchids or varicocele. Consult neurosurgeon and get help. Still if you have a query then feel free to ask. Happy to help you further.

Lymphnodes in maxilla can be due to 1. Infection2. Benign enlargement3. Malignant spread. Since you are also having pleural based lesion on CT thorax, possibility of either infection or malignant lesion is there. So better to get done ultrasound guided FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or biopsy from the Lymph nodes. This will diagnose the problem and start treatment accordingly.

You are fortunate for the following facts:1) To get an erection, men need healthy blood vessels, nerves, male hormones, and a desire to be sexually stimulated. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels and nerves that control erection. Therefore, even if you have normal amounts of male hormones, and you have the desire to have sex, you still may not be able to achieve a firm erection.2) Pts with Type 2 DM usually suffer from - Premature ejaculation, whereas you are c/o delayed ejaculation and that too with good libido. If you can't release your semen by regular intercourse - 1) Start intercourse only after fully aroused mentally (even though you have good libido) and think only sex (in any form) during intercourse 2) Oral and other ways can be tried. When God has given good libido and delayed ejaculation don't you think that it is too much to ask for a second erection within 1hr. Consider yourself that you are sex wise extraordinarily benefited and get satisfied and content with that. Best wishes                                                                                       To get an erection, men need healthy blood vessels, nerves, male hormones, and a desire to be sexually stimulated.

The pain and swelling could be because of tooth infection or gum infection. Consult an oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule out any remnants of roots of wisdom teeth or any infection in the adjacent or neighbor teeth. Take a course of antibiotic and analgesics and treat the teeth accordingly. The enlarged lymph nodes could be secondary to tooth infection. I hope my answer will help you.

Using icing for the ankle joint as well as the lower back to the pain sensation can be desensitized. If she is diabetic then hot water fermentation for the lower back and ankle. Also, try to stabilize the ankle joint in crêpe Bandage or ankle brace. Wait for the pain to come down.

Thanks for posting your query. As you clearly say there was no semen, you need not worry. There are so many cases like this I've come across. Basically semen has to enter vagina and then sperm swim across to the uterus for effective fertilization of ovum. So I suggest you not to worry. Wait for your cycle. Two options again. 1. If you menstruate as normal as be happy you are not pregnant 2. In case you don't menstruate, wait for 3 to 4 days and get an UPT check with kits available. Don't worry. We can still manage either ways. Hope this helps you, and you can contact back anytime.                                                                                                                      You need not worry.

You should go for Ultrasound guided biopsy of that lesion. It will give you some idea about diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly.

It could be a swollen lymph node due to throat infection and that's why the doctors have called for throat swab. It could be mastitis for which blood samples are necessary to check infection and if it comes out positive they will prescribe antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications for a week usually, and he will be fine, dont you worry. I would recommend tab Ibuprofen 200 mg thrice daily for 3 days (avoid on empty stomach) to relieve the pain, and it will settle the swelling too. Hope it will help.

Your daughters liver enzyme levels are quite high. The most common cause is viral hepatitis. Hepatitis viruses A, B, E can cause this picture. So tests to rule out these infections should be done. Hepatitis A and E are self limiting and will resolve on its own. But hepatitis B may or may not resolve and may enter a chronic phase. Damaged muscle can also increase these enzymes. But getting hit by a tennis ball may not damage the muscle to such an extent to cause an increase in the enzyme levels to this extent. If still in doubt CPK level may be checked which would also raise if it is due to muscle injury. Is this answer helpful?                                                                                                                 Your daughters liver enzyme levels are quite high.

I am CareConnect. I appreciate your concerns. Preejaculate does contain few sperms and so it can cause pregnancy. But in your case you have had sex in the safe period. A week before the expected period is safe. Having sex during that period does not result in pregnancy. In addition, she has used pill. So there is no question of pregnancy. Relax The delay in her period is because of the pill. In all probability she will start her periods within 10 days. So do not worry. I hope this is helpful.

The delay in her period is because of the pill.                                                                                                                       Having sex a week before the expected period is safe. She has used the contraceptive pill. She will start her period within 10 days.\n","18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hi, The symptoms are highly suggestive of possible lumbar radiculopathy with neurogenic claudication. I suggest testing MRI LS spine. I think you will detect that one of your nerves is getting compressed in the bones of the back. In such a case you will need to go for good physiotherapy. Medication like Pregabalin at bedtime will be of help.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
