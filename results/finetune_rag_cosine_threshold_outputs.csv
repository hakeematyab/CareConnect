On the next day i.e. 25th day, within 30 hours, I also took i-pill to be sure not to be pregnant. Now my period which was on due is still missing. What are the chances of my pregnancy? What should I do to terminate it, if I am pregnant? Kindly help me out.","Hello. I have reviewed your query thoroughly. I-pill or emergency contraceptive pills have very minimal chance of failure if taken immediately after intercourse within 24 hours and chances of failure gradually increase after that even if taken within 72 hours. There is about one to two percent chance of failure of an emergency pill or i-pill in your case. But we can be quite sure of its success if with ChatDoctor.  Based on the dates given by you, today must be 8 days following the date of the intercourse. In that case, to find out if you are pregnant, you can get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) testing done. For the urine pregnancy tests to show the result if pregnant, it must be at least 10 to 14 days following intercourse. If you want to know urgently whether you are pregnant, you can get serum beta hCG testing. If you can wait another week, you can get a urine pregnancy testing, which if positive must be followed up by ultrasound imaging. Only after then and after consulting an obstetrician, should the abortion be planned under guidance. Furthermore, if you are sexually active regularly, it is better to choose other regular contraceptive methods after consulting an obstetrician and gynecologist instead of i-pill. I-pills are meant to be taken only in case of unexpected accidental unprotected sex, but not on a regular basis.","I am 22 years old, on the pill for 2 months and I have had unprotected sex with my boyfriend 5 times and he has pulled out every time. I have a slight brownish discharge few days before my period, but both pregnancy tests I took were negative.
Even though you have negative pregnancy test, it doesn't mean you don't have pregnancy. You should wait for your due date of menses. If there is menses on time, you should confirm it with a pregnancy test.","Hi, Thanks for writing to us. Even if you are on contraceptive pills, there are chances that you may get pregnant, as the efficacy of contraceptive pill is not 100%. In your case, the possibility of pregnancy is very high. So I suggest you to go for a blood test for beta HCG (pregnancy hormone). If it is positive, then you need to consult a gynecologist and discuss about the options of termination. Hope this answers your query. Let me know if"
"Hello doctor,My mom had cough and cold which continued for a week. We conducted X-ray which indicated too much cough congestion in the chest and TLC count was 18K. One day, due to too much cough she vomited, and she was injected with a medicine to stop it and it worked. Next day, we went abroad for a week and as soon as we came back, we reconducted the X-ray which still indicates congestion is there and TLC count is now 15K. But she is getting fever since two days reaching up to 103. Crocin is not reducing it. I am really worried. Is it a viral fever? Or is it because of congestion. I am attaching the prescription/ medicines which she is taking as well as the latest blood report.","Hello. It is not a viral infection but a bacterial infection as her TLC has increased. Also, diabetic patients are prone to such infection. Treatment is antibiotics, which she has been started by her physician. In most patients, this resolves with a week. Continue other medicines as prescribed. We should see a response in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement in fever, cough, or increase in her symptoms like increased shortness of breath, visit a hospital as her antibiotics will need to be escalated and she may need higher IV antibiotics. If you have electronic BP apparatus, then monitor BP twice a day. Excessive fall in BP or decreased frequency of urination are some of the warning signs. Repeat TLC, urea and creatinine test to see antibiotics response. So overall, a majority of the patients recover well but some amount of risk is always there in such infections.

"Hello doctor,I am 20 years old. Two to three months ago, I started to have pain on my left testicle whenever I go out as I am usually at home. I speculate that I have varicocele as upon doing a self-examination, I found that the veins were bigger than the other testicle. There were no lumps found, but the left testicle feels bigger than the right one.I would say it is around 5 mm bigger in diameter. I do not have urinary problems like burning sensation. Although when it pains, my left lower abdomen and the pelvic area also hurt sometimes which could be due to lack of exercise as I am on my computer most of the time.The pain or ache on my left testicle usually appears when I am wearing tight pants. But I did not have this problem three months ago. I consulted a general practitioner, and he did a physical check and said it was likely due to congestion of the blood at the testicle. Do you think it could be an infection like epididymitis? I only had sex once in my life with my partner, but I do not have any other symptoms of STD. And do you think that there is something serious? Or is it probably due to congestion or tight pants?","Hello. Testicular pain with no obvious pathology on physical examination is common in young boys. As the testes descend through the lower abdominal wall, they carry spiral muscle which keeps them suspended in a dynamic position. Contraction of these muscles gives rise to pain. Tight pants press on the inguinal canal and may hinder venous return causing congestion. Wearing Langot (cotton strip worn by wrestlers to support testicles in India) will prevent their hanging, so there will be no muscle contraction. Get a USG scrotum (ultrasound). Wear scrotal support (langot). Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with concern. Tablet Pregabalin 75 mg with Mecobalamin (Methylcobalamin) at bedtime for 10 days.","For the last 2 weeks 22-year-old male has been having testicle pain. He was put on antibiotics for a week and now the pain is still there.

I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online",,"Hi, thank you for your question. Mild hemolytic anemia is a condition in which the red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them.

The crack or sharpness is due to the loss of tooth structure because of caries (cavity). Kindly take an IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) of both the teeth together (in one X-ray itself) and send it to me, along with a clear image of your teeth to help you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have or had pain, especially during chewing or sleeping? The treatment plan will vary based on the diagnosis. If the cavity has reached the pulp (blood supply of tooth), it will need a root canal treatment followed by a crown. If it is approximating the pulp, then we will give a temporary filling, wait for a month and if there are no symptoms, then we will change it to a permanent filling (restoration). If it is not even approximating pulp and is in dentin or just enamel (hard structures of teeth), then we will straight away go for permanent restoration (tooth filling). All these will eventually treat your cavity and the sharpness and the gap will go away. Kindly send me a clear picture and the radiograph to help you precisely. Take care. For more information consult a dentist online",,"Hi, I can understand your concern. I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get the tooth extracted. After extraction, you can get a denture or a bridge to fill the gap. Hope I have answered your query. Get well soon. Wish you a very good health. Available for further clarifications. Thanks.

"Hello doctor,This query is for my dad who is 75 years old. He has been seeing the same doctor who has recommended the same tests to be done for each follow-up since the past five years. Initially, he saw him once a year, recently it has become quarterly. I have uploaded a copy of the blood test reports and ECG was done for the follow-up on eighth of this month. Yesterday too he had to do a confirmatory blood test (Troponin) as well as ECG which confirmed he had a silent heart attack 10 days back. The admitting doctor after being informed of the test results recommended to stop Eliquis 2.5 mg 1-0-1 and take Ecosprin 150 mg 0-1-0 and tablet Plavix 75 mg 0-1-0. Also injection Clexane 80 mg SC twice a day for five days. He strongly advised getting admitted for a couple of days at least. My query is","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. So he did not have any symptoms, and this was detected on routine blood testing, right? His troponin is elevated here (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so it suggests he had a heart attack. So such patients are admitted for observation and administration of medications. We usually recommend admission immediately after a heart attack for 5 to 7 days, but since this time has already passed, admission is not absolutely necessary, but better to get admitted for observation, injectionClexane, and angiography. He should undergo echo and angiography, and for angiography, he has to be admitted. After angiography, he may need angioplasty or bypass. Also, if any warning signs like low bp or shortness of breath are there then he should be admitted.  Also, Clexane is blood thinner which helps in the dissolution of an already formed clot which is the reason for heart attack. So it should be given after heart attack.

"Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male, who is a competitive athlete. I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues. I have been diagnosed with WPW accidentally, and I am waiting for an ablation in 17 days. I am mostly asymptomatic, and I never had any extremely rapid heart rates. My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row. The EP I saw in the hospital prescribed me Flecainide 50 mg, twice daily. I saw another EP, who was a much older guy, as a second opinion. He seems to think I do not need the Flecainide, and maybe not even the ablation.

"Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old healthy woman. A few days ago, I noticed a small bony lump on the side of my foot below my ankle, which was not symmetrical on the other foot.

There was no pain when I touched it and no inflammation visible. I have attached a photo of it as well. You can easily see the pointy bony protrusion from that position.

"Hello doctor,My mother fell on her right arm. A few days later she noticed a wound on the dorsum of the right arm but was not sure if it was from the fall. She did not care for it nor treat it. About a week later she started disinfecting and covering it but decided to visit a dermatologist as she was afraid it might be something else. Upon the looks of it, the doctor wanted a biopsy as she said it could be cancerous too. While waiting for the results the wound closed and decreased in size and signs of inflammation are gone.Today we got the results and it says \\x80\\x9d hypodermis and dermis with hyperkeratosis, severe dysplasia of the squamous epithelium, chronic inflammatory changes in the dermis\\x80\\x9d.
