"Hello doctor,I have a query on ectopic pregnancy. My wife is having one and her beta hCG levels were 125.25 ml after taking her first shot of Methotrexate. Yesterday, she got her second shot and her beta hCG levels today were 141. I wanted to know how much time Methotrexate takes to low down those levels and I was wondering if we were a little hurried in taking the second dose so quickly.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I hope you had taken the Methotrexate dose under supervision only. The usual protocol is to check for a repeat beta hCG on the fourth day of taking Methotrexate.

"Hello doctor,My mom had cough and cold which continued for a week. We conducted X-ray which indicated too much cough congestion in the chest and TLC count was 18K. One day, due to too much cough she vomited, and she was injected with a medicine to stop it and it worked. Next day, we went abroad for a week and as soon as we came back, we reconducted the X-ray which still indicates congestion is there and TLC count is now 15K. But she is getting fever since two days reaching up to 103. Crocin is not reducing it. I am really worried. Is it a viral fever? Or is it because of congestion. I am attaching the prescription/ medicines which she is taking as well as the latest blood report.","Hello. It is not a viral infection but a bacterial infection as her TLC has increased. Also, diabetic patients are prone to such infection. Treatment is antibiotics, which she has been started by her physician. In most patients, this resolves with a week. Continue other medicines as prescribed. We should see a response in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement in fever, cough, or increase in her symptoms like increased shortness of breath, visit a hospital as her antibiotics will need to be escalated and she may need higher IV antibiotics. If you have electronic BP apparatus, then monitor BP twice a day. Excessive fall in BP or decreased frequency of urination are some of the warning signs. Repeat TLC, urea and creatinine test to see antibiotics response. So overall, a majority of the patients recover well but some amount of risk is always there in such infections.

"Hello doctor,I am 20 years old. Two to three months ago, I started to have pain on my left testicle whenever I go out as I am usually at home. I speculate that I have varicocele as upon doing a self-examination, I found that the veins were bigger than the other testicle. There were no lumps found, but the left testicle feels bigger than the right one.I would say it is around 5 mm bigger in diameter. I do not have urinary problems like burning sensation. Although when it pains, my left lower abdomen and the pelvic area also hurt sometimes which could be due to lack of exercise as I am on my computer most of the time.The pain or ache on my left testicle usually appears when I am wearing tight pants. But I did not have this problem three months ago. I consulted a general practitioner, and he did a physical check and said it was likely due to congestion of the blood at the testicle. Do you think it could be an infection like epididymitis? I only had sex once in my life with my partner, but I do not have any other symptoms of STD. And do you think that there is something serious? Or is it probably due to congestion or tight pants?","Hello. Testicular pain with no obvious pathology on physical examination is common in young boys. As the testes descend through the lower abdominal wall, they carry spiral muscle which keeps them suspended in a dynamic position. Contraction of these muscles gives rise to pain. Tight pants press on the inguinal canal and may hinder venous return causing congestion. Wearing Langot (cotton strip worn by wrestlers to support testicles in India) will prevent their hanging, so there will be no muscle contraction. Get a USG scrotum (ultrasound). Wear scrotal support (langot). Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with concern.

I have had gallbladder out four years ago, I bruise easily, I do get little red skin dots at times, menstrual cycles can be irregular and spleen slightly enlarged.","Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly.

If it is not even approximating pulp and is in dentin or just enamel (hard structures of teeth), then we will straight away go for permanent restoration (tooth filling).

"Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male, who is a competitive athlete. I do not have any structural or plumbing heart issues.

My resting heart rate is actually in the 40\\s. However, I do sometimes get palpitations and every once in awhile get a run of 5 to 7 in a row.

"Hello doctor,My mother fell on her right arm. A few days later she noticed a wound on the dorsum of the right arm but was not sure if it was from the fall. She did not care for it nor treat it. About a week later she started disinfecting and covering it but decided to visit a dermatologist as she was afraid it might be something else.

How is that determined? Is it a wound that is in the stages of healing or is it precancerous? What should be done in this case?Can we wait for one or two weeks to see if the crust will fall as in a healing wound and then perhaps have a biopsy on clean skin or should it be removed immediately with a suspicion that it might progress to cancer?

"Hello doctor,I have been trying to conceive since 9/11/2014, which is when I stopped birth control pills and started prenatal vitamins.My cycles before BCP (Birth Control Pills) were always regular, about 30 days +/- 1 day with a 7 day period.And on BCP, my cycles were always 28 days, with a 5 day period.When I stopped BCP, I had a 5 day period, which began my first cycle of 31 days.The next cycle began with a 6 day period and the cycle lasted 37 days.Then this current cycle, which began with a four day period, a bit lighter than normal.I am currently on CD 27 and I believe I ovulated 3-4 days ago.So, the problem here is that I start spotting on CD 25, along with light cramping.It was only a very little bit of light brown blood, so I did not think much of it.Yesterday, CD 26, I had a little more throughout the day, then quite a bit right before bed.This morning, I am still spotting but much heavier than the past two days, and am starting to get a little alarmed by this.The blood is still brown.

I have never spotted ever before.Also, I started taking Vitex at the beginning of this cycle in hopes of shortening my cycle a bit.Thank you in advance for any advice.","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. This could be ovulation bleeding. Usually it may take about 6 months to conceive after stopping the birth control pills.

There is possibility of DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) or ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion. It can be seen once your period date is over. Or you may get beta HCG levels tested to confirm this along with the scan (TVS - Transvaginal Scan).

She had her last period from 31st to 4th last month. She took the pill on 6th. Now, its been more than a week and she did not have her periods. Also, she is a virgin. Are there chances of pregnancy? For how much longer will the periods be delayed?","Hello. I have gone through your history and understand your concerns. As she had Unwanted 72, the chances of pregnancy are not there in your case.
